## Silly Stories

A silly story generator app for my son to use. He can add in his friend's names and get back a generated story from a small library of stories made by ChatGPT.

React application created with Next and using Typescript.

Just to note, this is the second version of this frontend, the first created with Vite. I wanted to make this one so I could do more straightforward testing with Jest.
